# XMLDOMParsing

        This is a HTML/JavaScript program, which takes a URL of an XML document containing Cable Network company information, parses the XML file, and extracts the list of cable networks, displaying them in a table. This involves accessing the elements of a page by taking advantage of its DOM Features. This program is best suited for Firefox. However, it should run in Chrome, IE, etc.
